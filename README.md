# Holda

**Holda** is a decentralized escrow platform built on the **Stellar network** that enables secure, trustless payments between buyers and sellers. Funds are held in escrow via smart contracts and released automatically once agreed conditions are met — no intermediaries, no delays, no disputes left unresolved.

Holda is powered by **Stella**, an AI assistant built into the platform to guide users through escrow creation, verification, and dispute resolution.

## Overview

Online transactions require trust between parties who may not know each other. This challenge is widespread across:

- Freelance marketplaces
- Peer-to-peer transactions
- Digital services
- E-commerce platforms
- Web3 marketplaces

Traditional escrow services depend on centralized intermediaries that introduce delayed payments, high fees, lack of transparency, platform censorship, and counterparty risk.

Holda solves these problems using the **Stellar network** — an open-source blockchain built for fast, low-cost, cross-border payments. Funds are securely locked, verified, and released automatically according to predefined rules. The result is a **trustless, transparent, and programmable payment system** for the modern internet.

| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Decentralized Escrow**     | Funds are locked on-chain — no third party controls them                                   |
| **Conditional Payments**     | Programmable release conditions: delivery, milestones, time-locks, multi-step verification |
| **Dispute Resolution**       | Contracts enter dispute mode with resolution mechanisms; decentralized arbitration planned |
| **Multi-party Verification** | Supports buyer + seller approval, escrow agent verification, and DAO arbitration           |

## How It Works

```
Step 1 — Create Escrow      Buyer defines: amount, recipient, release conditions, expiry
Step 2 — Deposit Funds      Buyer locks funds in the escrow contract
Step 3 — Execution          Seller delivers the agreed product or service
Step 4 — Verification       Conditions verified by buyer, both parties, or automated logic
Step 5 — Fund Release       Contract automatically releases funds to the seller
```

---

## Use Cases

- **Freelance Payments** — Clients lock funds before work begins; payment releases on completion
- **E-commerce** — Buyers purchase goods with funds held until delivery is confirmed
- **P2P Transactions** — Reduce fraud risk for individuals trading assets online
- **Web3 Marketplaces** — NFT platforms and decentralized exchanges can integrate Holda for escrow
- **Cross-border Payments** — Leverage Stellar's global anchor network for international transactions
- **Service Marketplaces** — Milestone-based payments for long-term or consulting projects

## Escrow State Machine

Every Holda escrow follows a defined lifecycle:

```
    +-----------+
    |  Created  |   Escrow initialized, terms defined, no funds yet
    +-----------+
          |
          | Buyer deposits funds
          v
    +-----------+
    |  Funded   |   Funds locked in contract
    +-----------+
          |
          | Seller performs work
          v
    +-----------+
    | Completed |   Seller marks work as complete
    +-----------+
      /         \
     /           \
    v             v
+-----------+  +-----------+
| Released  |  |  Dispute  |   Buyer approves → funds sent to seller
+-----------+  +-----------+   Dispute raised → enters resolution
                    |
                    v
              +-----------+
